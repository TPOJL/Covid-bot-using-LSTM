Three numbers x1, x2, x3 form a geometric sequence such that x1 â‰¥ x3. Given the sum of the numbers S = x1 + x2 + x3 and their product P = x1 * x2 * x3, determine these numbers.

It is not always possible (e.g., if the input data is invalid), in which case the expected output is: 0, 0, 0.


### Notes:

You are allowed to use only float type for floating-point numbers. Use of double will cause the solution to be rejected.

Results must be printed in scientific notation with 10 significant digits.

A solution is accepted if, for each output number, either:

the absolute error is less than 1e-25, or

the relative error is less than 1e-6.
